At first she found it absolutly hysterical that when she pulled the string it follows her.  She loves pulling it around the house and its very sturdy and doesn't tip over all the time.  We have carpeting and hardwood floors and it works fine on both.  She has even taken it outside and it works well there too (on the sidewalk).  We have had this toy for over 2 months and my daughter enjoys it immensely.  I highly recommend it.  It's one of her favorite toys that she uses daily."
nlp-input-text-2, "Took me over 2 hours to assemble this toy...had to keep shooing my kid to the next room so she won't walk away with any of the pieces...Like everyone else who dislike the assembling part, I was quite disappointed to see a bunch of plastic pieces stuck together in "clusters" that I had to physically cut apart b4 attempting to assemble...this took FOREVER, not to mention finding the right piece that matches the instruction AND making sure after it's cut out that it doesn't get lost!!why couldn't the manufacturer put the modules together into larger, assembled pieces and all parents have to do is put together those modules (ie fridge, stove, microwave etc) onto the frame itself? Why make it so difficult for us to have to start "from scratch" in cutting out EACH INDIVIDUAL plastic piece from various clusters? And what I find even more terrible is that we have to also put those stickers that indicate where the switches are on the dish washer, microwave etc...can't they put that together b4 shipping it out?If it weren't for the price I would not have gotten this item. But even so, the saving is not enough to justify the time it takes to assemble this thing, especially when you have a kid waiting impatiently to play w/ it...I jammed several fingers w/ the screw driver as I was trying to keep my kid happy and assemble this thing at the same time..."

Good size for her hands and the other kids enjoy it, too. The strip around it makes it very unique and that's cool. Before it got really cold we played with it outside in dusk and it was a lot of fun. Easy to throw and catch. Plus, it's held up very well, even after being dropped - or thrown - onto the driveway several times! Highly recommend for younger ones especially."

nlp-input-text-9, "The Tonka Chuck & Friends Flip the Bounce Back Racer is okay for three- to six-year-olds but older children get bored quickly.  With two cars they could race them, but with one car, the fun is limited to bumping into things and chasing each other going backwards & forwards, either inside or on a hard surface outdoors, as there is no steering mechanism.It will run up a slope with enough speed and, with some practice, flip over, at least sometimes.  The car also speaks enthusiastically and the little ones loved that although I found it annoying after just a few minutes.The car and remote together take a total of eight AA batteries (which I was surprised to find are NOT included) so I suggest rechargeableeneloops.Overall, it is reasonably well-made for a plastic toy."
nlp-input-text-10, "I got this for my daughter at 10 months for Christmas.  She loved it then and still loves it, and she is 16 months old.  I like that she can stack the blocks, shake the blocks, and also pull the alligator behind her.  She likes the music and rolling the eyes of the alligator too.  I am not as crazy about the music, but it does play "it's raining it's pouring" and I think a couple of other songs.  She likes to also turn the alligator over and push the button on the bottom (little black button that is more apparent when the pull part is up)that turns off the current music and makes a strange wood block sound (sorry that is all I can compare it to).  So I hear a lot of noises on a daily basis from that thing.  She liked it a lot initially because she was into pushing cars around and now that she is older is is fun for her to have it trail after her.  She plays with it at least some way (playing with the blocks or pulling the 'gator) at least once a day.  I would suggest this to someone if their child is into pushing cars around on the floor or likes stacking blocks things on each other(of course they should be in the age group that this is intended).  It isn't for all children of course, but I realized what my child like doing and this was what I picked.  I definitely appreciate my choice, the only thing else I would like to note is that after over 8 months is that I have only changed the batteries once.  Which is not to bad in my book."

It comes in tiny pieces that all snap together, and it is very easy to get frustrated. The top two platforms aren't very secure and slide out when you move the castle. It took me about 30 minutes to fully assemble, which is kind of ridiculous.It only comes with one princess  and a small mouse that slide down the slide and spin. It's very cute and my daughter was highly entertained.The bottom platform also spins by using a small scissor like handle. It comes with a small bed and some dishes. Warning - the dishes are VERY small and are easily a choking hazard. This is definitely not for young toddlers and those that need supervision!"

nlp-input-text-16, "Every child should have this toy!!!  My kids outgrew this toy a long time ago (they are 5 and & now) and I always remembered it as one of the most played with toys when they were young.  It was one of my favorites.This thing lasted threw 2 toddlers, it has been dropped, kicked and thrown and it still worked until the day I gave it away to another child.  My kids would take it off of the fridge and carry it around like a boom box.  They both loved the song and I thought it was cute.HIGHLY recommend this toy.  My nephew will be one in August and I assure I will be giving him this toy for his first birthday."
nlp-input-text-17, "About a year ago I helped out at my Sunday school church in the third thru fifth grade class rooms and noticed a small crowd of mostly boys playing with this toy. They were pretty quiet as they were concentrating & working together to build a huge tower. I thought the toy looked interesting enough that I purchased it for my then 4 yr old boy that Christmas. Not only does he love to play with it, but I was really surprised that my 2 and a half year old boy loved it as well and was not too young to play with it. I had purchased the 230 piece set. Now, this Christmas coming up, I will give them the 400 piece set. This will enable them to build larger things. I absolutely recommend this toy. Children will play with it for many years before outgrowing it. We have some damage to several of the straws only because our kitten chewed on them. Plan on buying a plastic tub to keep the pieces in, as the box it comes in is pretty cheap. Great toy for creating 3D cages the kids can climb into, cubes, and towers that can block off entire doorways. After almost a full year, my boys still love this toy."
nlp-input-text-18, "I got this for my son's first Christmas, which was a mistake.  He was too young but the older kids loved it.  One of the older kids loved it too much and discovered that the mallet, which has very square corners, could be used to make delightful dents in drywall.  And then in the process of the wreckertons playing with it, one of the wooden ramps inside came out (we could have glued it back in promptly and it would have been fine, but then it disappeared, as toys do) and the yellow ball went AWOL.  So now we are missing a ball and a ramp.  I put the toy away for a while, got it out again a few months ago - baby was 20 or 21 months old.It's a GREAT toy.  I'd say ideal for 18m and up.  It takes just enough resistance to pound the balls through the holes that it is the right balance between challenging and rewarding.  It makes a nice clackity sound as the ball rolls through - even minus a ramp.  Simple means of teaching colors and numbers 1-4 to a very young child.  Just plain fun for a little one.My daughter seems to have outgrown her hunger for destroying drywall so that's good.  We haven't lost any more ramps so just that one must have been loose - it's totally and easily fixable if you have this issue, you just need to do it before you lose it."

However, it was faded and not missing pieces unlike what has happened with some other temporary tattoos."

Although it's an easy toy to set aside and forget about, she really likes playing with it when she comes across it. It works great as a magnifying glass, but is sturdy and safe (not made of glass). It doesn't magnify a huge amount, but enough to make a difference, especially for a small child. I highly recommend it for any curious little one!"

nlp-input-text-31, "I'm very thankful for the previous reviews as this led us to purchase this item.It is AWESOME!  We added it to the Thomas Water Tower Figure 8 set. The bridge on that set kept coming apart & so we decided to add this & am so glad we did!Not only do the wooden Thomas trains fit on this so do some miscellaneous mini cars.  We had some Tonka cars we bought from KOHL's & they fit perfectly (NOTE: on Amazon I'm pretty sure this is the item in case you want to buy them as they are really cute & fun for toddlers: Tonka: Chuck and Friends Train Fleet).  So they can play w/ both the trains & the cars.  Not all cars will, but some do.This has been very educational.  They learn to put the track together & that for the trains to zoom out the door they have to have them @ the top & let go.  They can have multiple trains together too.  As other reviewers have noted, toddlers for some reason want to put things in upward/backwards through the door.  I think this is just a learning phase which is neat to watch.  They are figuring it out. So far, we haven't had anything get stuck or anything & hopefully won't in the future.I am so glad I purchased this & it is our favorite piece we've bought so far for the Thomas tracks."

Then he tore into the puzzle and had it done in about 15-20 minutes.  He has redone it at least 5 or 6 times since.  I am trying to get him to share it with his pre-K class but he declines - afraid they won't give it back!  It is really a lot of fun as the pieces are big and the picture is not too complicated."
nlp-input-text-34, "My 4-year-old grandson is addicted to all things superhero, and one of his favorite heroes is Spiderman. This plastic plane was an instant hit -- and best of all, it required NO batteries as it has no electronics (which is getting rare in toys these days). The plane is the perfect size for him to &#34;fly&#34; while running around the house and the clear plastic canopy lifts up to put Spiderman inside the cockpit. The figure lays down on its back in the plane and is larger than usual in size making it easy for little fingers to grip.The two shooting &#34;projectiles&#34; provided a lot of enthusiasm -- they click into each front wing and when the button is pressed, the two soft plastic pieces are shot from the plane fairly gently and without a lot of velocity from their ports. He loved it --  and there's not much chance of those plastic projectiles hurting anyone or causing damage. In addition, when you squeeze its legs, Spiderman's hand shoots out mimicking a web strike. We were able to imagine lots of dangerous missions for hours of fun.This toy looks very durable and I love that it makes no noise! I'm sure he will enjoy it for a long time. I did notice his little brother (age 1) had his eye on it too!"

Upon first appearance they look soft and cuddly and they are to a point, but with the mechanics inside the middle is hard. It has three modes:  1.Singing  2.Harmony 3.Chatter.  I thought them singing Hello Ma Baby was adorable and I love their teeth. That is a funny, cute feature. I'm sure children will love them as well. The only problem  with the song was that you have to keep pushing to hear the song. A smaller child may never get through it. The song was very clear however.  The chatter was just that chatter, but I assume a child would giggle at it. I think this is different and children like different. It certainly seems that it would entertain a little one and  keep them entertained."

It doesn't feel like the cheap plastic stuff you tend to find in stores these days. This also brought back childhood memories of the Little People Treehouse from the 70s for me. Play value is excellent. My 10 year old absolutely loved everything about the cute little dolls with button eyes and the neat stitch-work look of the trees. The little elevator, donut swing, etc. will keep your child entertained. The detail in the play-set looks like it's been sewn together giving you the idea of a home-made toy. It's not as small as it looks either. You get quite a bargain in the parts/accessories that come within the set. It is by no means chintzy. Best of all, we didn't have the hassle of crazy assembly. Hands down, this will be an excellent gift for any child ages 5 & up that are interested in the Lalaloopsy dolls."

nlp-input-text-42, "This is the sweetest doll I've seen in a long time. She is a combination of the traditional, huggable baby doll and technology. There are 150+ actions, sounds & phrases. She actually responds to touch. She's a great way to distract "mommy" out of a cranky mood. It's hard to be cranky when this doll says all those loving phrases and needs attention.The electronics make it difficult to dress and undress her. They also make her a little 'hard' and less huggable.She has an adorable voice and a sweet disposition. How can a doll have a sweet disposition? The things she says and does. "I love you, bear! You're the best bear in the whole world!" (and she kisses the bear with a loud kissing noise), and "I love you THIS much (and her arms go out to show you how much she loves you." Nice eye lashes!She works on magnets and 4 AA batteries, batteries included. One plus for me is the fact that she doesn't seem to "require" more accessories. I went to their web site at littlemommy.com and there are plenty of accessories, but the doll does fine without them. If you want to buy the stroller, pony, bed, shopping cart, bath & training set, high chair, play pen, and/or crib, they are available, but definitely not necessary. This doll comes with enough accessories to keep a child busy and happy. I would suggest counting the accessories and having a special storage place for them at the end of the day. Otherwise you will be pulling long searches for a spoon or Bandaid, because your child won't want to be without them.Positives: This is such an adorable doll!Negatives: There are none. I love her already.Make sure not to lose the bear, juice pop, wash cloth, head band,  band aid (which looks like a plastic bracelet), dish, and spoon. I would advise open the box very carefully, from the back side of the box, as designed. That makes things much easier to clip and remove.EDITED after 2 days of listening to her constant chatter. The adults were all joking about her maniacal laugh. Lots of jokes about wasn't she the doll in the horror movie, etc, but the children ignored the jokes and kept running to feed her and fix her 'owee' and give her bear to her whenever she talked. SHE HAS AN ON-OFF SWITCH and we did use it.  :)"

nlp-input-text-44, "I had reservations on this toy, but am happy I bought it b/c it is really fun! It is like an update to the old favorite Transformers. Transformers are still loved; however, I do like that these have sound. And, the switch back & forth between the vehicle & the dinosaur is EXTREMELY easy which is appreciated so little one's can enjoy this too. The quality is excellent. The wheels on the car roll really smoothly & each part clicks/pops/changes into it's spot really easily. I first bought the blue Triceratops so far, but after seeing how much fun & enjoyment this is bringing I bought the other's as well & am just as happy w/ them. It is good to have several of them to "race".  If you do have any of the Transformers, these change back & forth very similarly; however, I did notice a big difference in the ease of doing so. And, these stay in their positions better. By that I mean if you click to a car then it is solidly the car & vice versa. Whereas, on the Transformers, we have a hard time getting them to stay in either postion. The head would pop-up/etc. These VTech Switch & Go Dinos are wonderful. I highly recommend & have bought all 4 offered. Price is in line w/ the quality & fun of the toy. Pleasant surprise. I'm not an expert, but I think this would be a good toy for 2 1/2 & older. If given younger, they will need help & you do need to watch they don't get their fingers pinched, but as they grow into them they will be able to do on their own & have a blast. It is fun to see them race these & I know I noted it above already, but I was very happy about how smooth the wheels roll. That seems like an odd thing to point out, but it is appreciated when car toys roll really well & don't make sounds/seem to get stuck or don't roll smoothly - so hard to put into words, but I think you'll know what I mean when you roll this - just really smooth. The actual toy itself does make really cool racing sounds though while in the car position & the Triceratops makes cool growling/etc noises. Great toy for BOTH boys & girls who enjoy cars, racing, Transformers, dinosaurs, etc."

Assorted (and finely detailed!) tiles about 40 in number can be drawn by two to five players from a box. The player then connects the tile to the main board, where the depictions of grass, castle and road drawings must correspond to other adjacent tiles. Once a tile is placed, the player may place a piece on the board, and these men help the player garnish points through completing streets, castles, monasteries or fields. The fun of the game involves the luck of the draw and the strategy of whether to build up your creations or make it difficult for the other participating players.My wife and I laid the foundation for our relationship while playing this game during our courtship, and we continue to play in our marriage.

I also purchased the Melissa and Doug Easel Accessory set and I am glad that I did. I saw that some people complained about the Accessory set but I thought that it was worth the money because I didn't have to go through the hassle of looking for paper, paint cups, paint,  brushes, eraser, etc, etc. from somewhere else. The only other thing is that  I wish that I would have bought the Melissa and Doug Artist's Smocks, too. I had bought two at one of my local dollar stores for $1 each, and one of them broke on the first use. I wish that I would have just paid the 9 bucks to have one that would hopefully last longer."

I placed the 70mAh battery under the belly directly under the main rotor shaft. This did extend the flight time and made the helicopter very stable and even easier to fly.  I splice and solder the 70mAh battery with the stock battery. See pics to see both batteries installed. I did this as a temporary modification until I did the upgrade with 3.7V Lithium Polymer 240 mah Battery. Once the 240 mah Battery came in, I'd installed it and removed both 70mah and stock 150mah batteries. Then I notice better speed and performance. Great helicopter to fly."

In many of the Barbies over the last few years this was often typified by replacing doll and costume quality with gimmickry, and I'm happy to see the Pink Shoes collection is much better made.This transforming Kristyn doll uses a clever mechanic to reverse the skirt from purple-blue Odette/Giselle-inspired storyline skirt to the full pink Barbie-esque one that Kristyn wears at the end.  I had concerns about whether the doll would survive my overly-enthusiastic 6yo and 3yo, but they've had her for a couple months of regular play and she's still fine (a serious accomplishment, actually).While they did pose Kristyn's hands and feet in ballet pose, they made her knees straight.  I thought that strange since both theGiselleandOdettedolls have bendable knees that, when pushed into pli&eacute;, cause them to entrechat like Kristyn does in the movie.  You'll also notice from those two dolls that this "transforming" Kristyn doesn't really look like either of them when changed.  Fortunately kids at that age are full of imagination, and that sort of petty detail is solidly in the realm of grown-up gripe.For my girls, Barbie's transformation and the fun they have acting out scenes fromthe movieis as magical as the source stories.

Definitely as tough as advertised, which is amazing. It's easy to use. It's got a swiveling lens so your child can take a self-portrait, which is really neat and provides lots of entertainment. It's got an auto-shut-off feature, which is wonderful because my son always leaves his toys on, draining the batteries.- The Bad: well, if you're looking for professional quality pictures, you'll be disappointed. My son doesn't care about this. If you do, don't get this camera. Also, the camera makes noises when buttons are pressed, and (as far as I know) you can't turn these off, so you may not want to have Junior play with this during a wedding or something. Finally - really, Fisher-Price, you couldn't have thrown in a cheapie USB cable? Shame.All in all, this is a fun toy and a great way to get your child interested in taking pictures. Despite some reservations on my part, it's sure to be a hit with younger children, especially ones who have shown an interest in using your camera."

Younger children are able to color because the markers do not color on anything except the special paper--not on clothes, kids, furniture or walls.  Perfect for travelling and anytime something is needed to entertain young children."
nlp-input-text-59, "My son loves this &#34;fire smasher&#34; - he calls it.  I don't like it becuase I feel each disc should make a different sound - they all make the same noise. But my son doesn't notice and really likes it. A friend brought over a sword and the two seem compatible (they fit together). Didn't know that so that was a fun surprise if you're in the market for two toys. Decent quality and I don't think I paid that much for it. So good buy, I suppose."
nlp-input-text-60, "Leapster is a wonderful, durable and entertaining product for young children. The finding Nemo cartridge has kept my 5 year old grand daughter captivated, entertained for hours. While many of the cardridges are very learning skills focused, this catridge emophasizes fun, humor and helping others. Battery life is excellent even when played for hours at a time. The unit survives the beating of a two year old sister without a hitch. The game and cartridge are well suited for a five year old."

nlp-input-text-65, "These are a set of dice with various pictures on each side, such as a sleeping face, a turtle, or an arrow.These work as ice breakers, as a storytelling game component, or as a way to get kids rolling dice and making up stories.  They aren't really a game themselves as much as a tool.If you want something to help people talk, or to constrain storytelling, these work great."

nlp-input-text-67, "I am a puzzle maniac, having assembled jigsaw puzzles from 100 to 9000 pieces (a 13200 pieces is in the queue and I am really going to the 18,000 and 32,000 pieces from Ravensburger in the future...). Some of them were 3D puzzles, like the Taj Mahal, US Capitol, Neuschwanstein Castle, Big Ben, etc. This one in particular is a very high quality product from Ravensburger (as usual), all the pieces have an excellent finishing and they stick together very well. I usually assemble this size of puzzles in Foam Boards. They are very light and conveniently cheap. The foam board being 3/16'' (5mm) gives your puzzle enough support. I usually cut the board (easily done with a cutter) after glueing the puzzle, leaving a border of 1'' at each side, so I can pin the board in my garage (that, at this point, is full of puzzles...). For puzzles 5,000 pieces and larger I usually go with a 4'x8'x5/32'' plywood that I pre-cut at the size of the puzzle plus 1 inch extra on each side... This is heavier and a little more expensive, but gives better support and for that size of puzzle I need that extra support. You might be able to accommodate up to a 6,000 piece in one of those 4'x 8' (feet) boards. So far I have assembled 2 x 5,000 pieces, 1 x 6,000, 1 x 8,000 pieces and 1 x 9,000, besides dozens of 3,000 and smaller. What help me a lot is that my wife and daughters also like the challenge, so we move fast. A 1,000 piece puzzle do not last a weekend, although the 8,000 piece one took us 2 months (most 2 to 3 hours at night work) to put together. This one in particular took us 5 days to put together, as it has a good amount of sky and the reflections are never easy. I highly recommend Ravensburger products for the excellent quality to everyone that enjoys challenges alone or with the whole family. It is a guaranteed entertainment for hours, listening to music or talking in family environment.Amazon.com was kind enough to provide this product for me through their Vine Program for reviewing and I was not request to provide a positive review. Opinions expressed here are my own."

It's a bit tricky and difficult to put together but with a bit of upper body strength and some determination you can accomplish it.

nlp-input-text-74, "My daughter received these for her birthday, along with the castle. Both of my daughters love playing with the set and have a great time pretending they are princesses too.The only problem I have found is that two of the princesses have split personalities. Snow White seems to think she is both Snow White and Jasmine. Rapunzel seems to think she is Rapunzel and Ariel. Now, since we have Ariel, my daughter asked if it is okay that Rapunzel also thinks that she is Ariel. I asked and Ariel doesn't seem to mind. However, since we don't have Jasmine, I think Snow White is safe from ridicule for the time being!"

nlp-input-text-76, "I bought this toy for my daughters 3rd birthday and it is in the bathtub everytime she takes a bath and she shows no interest in it what so ever. the boots character i threw away due to mold and my daughter hasn't even noticed. I don't recall a tree being attached to it i'll have to look again. I am thinking about actually taking this to the pool to see if she will play with it there."
nlp-input-text-77, "Our girls love this!!  They are 2 and 4 and love this camera. They were constantly getting mine out of my purse and I said no more!  I found this one and bought it based on reviews and we are very happy. They really enjoy taking pictures. And they like the little add ons you can add to pictures. Super cute!!"
nlp-input-text-78, "The TRIO Hot Wheels Stunt Ramp Builder set is super cool.  The TRIO blocks are easy to build with, they just snap together and stick in place.  While this set starts at ages 3 and up, I will say it does take an adult to help build the sets but kids can of course play around with snapping the pieces together.  There are different configurations you can build which make for more fun it gives you lots of options!Once the set was built it stayed up pretty well.  I was able to pick it up and move it around without it coming apart.  Now of course if you don't handle it properly the pieces will come apart, but it just add to the fun by rebuilding it.  It is the perfect size for kids and my boys (3 and 4) really got a kick out of it.  They now want more of the TRIO blocks to play with and I even found that there are other TRIO Hot Wheels sets you can add in.  You do get a green Hot Wheels car that you build with the TRIO blocks but my boys also include their other regular Hot Wheels cars.Overall, this set is great for any Hot Wheels fan.  You get the fun of not only building your stunt sets but then by playing with it.  You get tons of pieces and the instructions show clear pictures of how to build the sets."

nlp-input-text-81, "Mattel's Movie Masters Batman has a great amount of detail to him. His sculpt is great, his paint is pretty good, and his articulation is really good.Batman's sculpt is based off his appearance in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. This design has become my favorite of the Batman designs, and the mold does an excellent job recapturing it. The one thing I don't like about it is that the cape is made of a pretty sturdy plastic, which gets in the way of his posing.He has a really nice paint job, at least for what it's supposed to be. Obviously, his suit is almost completely black, so you're not going to see a whole lot of coloring. However, Mattel went the extra mile and gave him multiple shades of black, so it doesn't look boring. The only thing I would have changed paint-wise is that his pupils are a solid black. This is the only thing that makes it seem like a bigger version of their 3 3/4&#34; action figures. I think it would have been better if they had eye color to them.His articulation is very good. He is able to move pretty much everywhere. As I already stated, the only problem is the fact that his cape gets in the way of posing him.The only other problem I have with him is his accessories, or rather his lacking of them. As an adult collectible, you would think he would feature a lot of cool things to display him with. Sadly, this is not the case. The only thing he comes with is a stand for the build-a-batsignal feature. This entire system feels gimmicky and childish for an adult collector's toy line.Though it's not perfect, the Movie Masters Batman is probably the best plastic depiction of the film incarnation of the character yet. I recommend this to any collector who loves watching the Dark Knight trilogy."
nlp-input-text-82, "Made out of heavy duty plastic, this set includes a Large Smurf house, which was very easy to assemble, a small Gargamel figure and the smurfs, including Papa and Smurfette. I only wish Gargamel was larger than the Smurfs, more true to form."

The Soma Cube idea is far more difficult than pentominosbecause of 3-Dimensional irregular shapes. I know for me, with many ofthese challenges I am almost close but am one block off-target. Nevertheless,it is still a good solitary brain teaser since regardless of spatial abilityit does improve spatial perception."
nlp-input-text-84, "My wife and I were looking for a relatively simple (and portable) game we could take with us on overnight trips to visit family and on vacations.  So, we decided to give &#8220;Square Shooters The first deck of cards on dice&#8221; a try.  My wife played the game with oou eight year old son.  Below are her comments:This is a terrific new idea for avid card players.  If you are ready for something different, there are plenty of variations to keep you busy with this card/dice set.  Recommended ages are 8 and up, but I think it&#8217;s only appropriate at that age if your child is already familiar with card games like rummy.  But I would put this on the &#8220;great gift&#8221; list for ages 10 and up.  Four stars."
nlp-input-text-85, "This is a cute little doll that is sturdy. She is kind of funny with her huge head and tiny body.It says the doll is for 5+yr olds. This must be for the use of the computer and the tiny shoes. Mine will be played with by a 2.5yr old and she is fine with not putting things in her mouth.I went online and checked out the activities and they are educational. You choose your doll, only one. You can play games and there are lessons on playing nice and recycling items, things like that. I played one game on the easy level with the musical notes...lol a 5 yr old could probably do better than I did. There are little video's to watch also. Very child friendly but it does require going online, without that it is just a little doll.My biggest disappointment is that Makayla Song doll loves music and plays the guitar. You only get the cardboard one that is part of the package. I think they could have included a little plastic guitar maybe instead of the charm.Over all it is cute and it has the bonus of some good morals taught online about living in our world being nice to it and to each other."
nlp-input-text-86, "Truth be Told is an excellent party game.  The game encourages good conversations. Truth be Told is best played with good friends and is a fun way to get to known your friends even better.On your turn you write down your answer to the question asked. At the same time the other players write down what they think your answer will be. The other players could write down serous or funny answers. You than collect all of the cards and read them aloud, including yours. The other players than guess the answer they think is your answer. Points are award to anyone who had their question picked as the correct answer.I recommend Truth be Told to anyone looking for a fun new party game."

nlp-input-text-89, "As usual, Eeboo does a wonderful job with this game.  The pictures are fantastic - a work of art.  The pieces are thick and durable.  It's appealing and inviting.  We also have the Hasbro "Original Memory Game," which has SEVENTY tiny cards with treacly, goofy cartoons on them, and I find it incredibly annoying.  The Life on Earth memory game is light years better - creative, artistic, thicker pieces, just much nicer overall.  Worth a few dollars more."

nlp-input-text-91, "This is a nice puzzle that offers can occupy a child for a while, provided a child has enough patience, or serve as a quick child-parent game.  Puzzle pieces are made of thick plastic, they fit snugly, and the completed puzzle is sturdy.  The puzzle comes with a display stand.  The puzzle is about as challenging as a LEGO set, because both provide instructions on what to do.My 4 1/2 year old son and I put this puzzle together in about 30 minutes.  In the beginning I was sorting pieces and he was assembling the puzzle.  All pieces are numbered and have directional arrows showing where the next piece goes.  It was pretty easy for my son to assemble to piece #100, at which point he started looking for piece #200 because he only knew how to count in hundreds past 100.  So, I explained to him that after 100 comes 101, which I thought to be a nice teaching moment.By this point, I have already sorted all pieces and arranged them in groups of ten.  I began assembling the puzzle beginning with the piece #130 and up.  When my son installed piece #129, we joined the part he was assembling with the part that was assembled by me and then quickly finished the remaining 20 or so pieces.The result was a pretty colorful and sturdy ball showing a picture of the NY Times Square at night."
nlp-input-text-92, "My kids love this thing but I hate it. When it works it works great but when it clogs or jams I just want to toss it out the window. We take this thing apart (the gear section) regularly to get out clogged playdoh or unstick jammed gears. I think this toy was a great concept/idea with exceptional potential but the execution of the gear section is just terrible.  Great fun (when it works) for kids but a total frustration for parents. If you get this make sure you keep your screwdriver handy at all times....you will need it."
nlp-input-text-93, "It broke down in the very first use. Just putting the batteries. I could not connect it. This is a waste of money."
nlp-input-text-94, "I was a bit skeptical about this puzzle, namely how sturdy it was going to be, and how easily the structure would hold its shape.  That said, the Puzzleball was fun to put together, and holds up really well.  The pieces are hard plastic, and generally fit quite well with each other.  The ball holds its shape nicely while you build it, although putting the last pieces in (the north or south pole, depending on how you started) is a bit trickier, since you can only push from the inside.  You can build it two ways.  The easier way is by using the numbers on the back of each piece, and the harder way is by visually fitting the pieces, like any normal puzzle.  Due to the 3D nature and abundance of blue pieces, this second method is more of a challenge, especially for younger puzzlers.  The globe comes with two display stands- the rotating arm shown on the box, or a simpler saucer-type stand to allow picking up, etc.  The maps is full of fun little details and while is hardly cartographer-grade material, it's perfect for kids.  Recommended."

nlp-input-text-102, "In a recent review, I complained about the lack of sturdiness of modern toys.  However, this play house is sturdy and seems as though it would provide many years of play to several generations of children.  The play house is also pretty, and large enough that you could stuff a lot of things into it.The only complaint I have about this play house is the lack of pirate-related stuff to go into it.  You do get some blocky figures and cannons, but no pirate treasure, no steering wheel, no little pirate swords, or anything similar.  I suppose that if you were trying to give this play house to a small child, the lack of small parts could be an advantage.  However, if I were a small child, I would be asking mom and dad for stuff to go into my pirate play house.If you are looking for a play house for a small boy or girl, this play house is a winner from the perspective that it seems like it would take a lot of abuse.  On the flip side, it includes very few features, so you end up populating the play house with other toys you have.  This play house begs for some sort of add on feature or set(s) that allow a child to expand play possibilities.Enjoy!"

It worked well both times, but there a definitely cards in it that can incite some arguments if you happen to be playing with certain people who can't laugh at themselves a bit. I would recommend you get the expansions as they will help to keep the game fresh and give you the option to create your own cards. After a few plays with just the base set, the same cards will eventually come up and the laughter can die down if you can't come up with fresh combos. It's a fun game though and I really enjoy it with my family especially."

And yes, they don't even roll all that great on carpet either but well enough that you can push it and it will move a few feet. Has this affected my son's enjoyment of it? Sure doesn't seem like it. I bought this for him at about a year old. He's been playing with it for a year now and he still enjoys it. That (his enjoyment) being the point I have to give it five stars overall and I like that it was made in USA. He also is sometimes pretty rough with it and pushes down on it while zooming around the living room and it's help up, the only "damage" to it are some cosmetic modifications he made to it courtesy of his crayola crayons (also made in USA)."

After reading all the wonderful reviews, I was excited to order it for him. He has a birthday right after Christmas so finding something else for him is sometimes difficult. He liked it at first, but really he hasn't played with it much since. I know the age recommendation is 6+ BUT my one and a half year old LOVES playing with them. At first, she was a little scared of them when they made a noise but she got over it in a couple days. She brings them to me often as says &#34;high&#34; for me to hide them. The only thing negative I have to say is that it does take almost three minutes before they start to make noise as a hint for you to find them. I guess I just assumed it would have been faster. I actually hide them for my kids in the house and they forget about them and go about playing with other toys until they hear them, then they go hunt. I guess the long wait time would be better if playing outside or with a bunch of kids who are hiding them and take a long time to finally pick a hiding spot. I can say that my daughter has dropped them A LOT on our tile floor and they are still working great, so they definitely seem well made. Hopefully these will be more of a hit with my son once spring/summer is here and we can play with them outside."

nlp-input-text-115, "This, like most ThinkFun games, is a solitary thinking game, but my kids really like it.  To play, you pick a card and set up the game pieces accordingly.  Your goal is to get your man from his starting location to the designated ending location.  He can walk along crates and tip them over to get to the next crate (the tipping is quite gratifying to the kids for some reason).  Once a crate is tipped over, you can't move it, although you may find yourself backtracking over it.  If you are stuck, the answers are printed on the back of each card. When you are finished, toss it into the handy storage bag until the next time you or your kids need an interesting diversion.It is not specifically an educational game, but it does provides practice in visualization, spatial skills, planning a few moves ahead, and thinking!I do wish there was an easy way to get replacement pieces.  We've lost a couple of crates, but can still play most of the cards.All in all, a great game."
nlp-input-text-116, "This is far more than I had expected.  I thought it was a simple paint by numbers kind of thing with caked watercolors.  It's not that.  It's liquid watercolors with an eyedropper for precise control on how much goes into the pallet, a good, reusable plastic pallet with 20 compartments, a piece of heavy watercolor paper for testing colors, and three fabulous panels on heavy paper.The paintbrush is double sided, which is odd but not horrible.The paints supplied are blue, red, purple (in the red family), yellow, and black.  Most purists say you don't need white -- just let the white of the paper through.  I'm a fan of white for when I want a pastel effect -- pink is not quite the same thing as pale red -- but that's very much a minority opinion.The paper feels like a smooth cold press.  That means it has more texture (and more grip) than a hot press, but not so much texture that it becomes a design element in its own right.This can serve as both an arts and crafts hobby kit, and as a serious introduction to the art of watercolor painting.  The instructions are well suited for a first lesson.  It's supposed to be for ages 8 - 13, but it's sophisticated enough, and engaging enough, to be fun for teenagers and adults as well."

nlp-input-text-122, "My daughter (5) is quite the tea party buff. She has even been able to convince her two brothers to join her for tea parties and has thrown "official" tea parties for her friends. She was my official tester for this set. This set definitely has the cuteness factor you would expect in a tea set. It also food grade, meaning you can put drinks (like lemonade) in the cups, food on the plates, etc. This is important because some manufacturers are stupid enough to put tea sets on the market using materials that aren't food grade - so kids can't really use them!The set worked well. Don't overfill the teapot or it can leak, but this is still good for a "party".These are NOT dishwasher safe. Not a bad thing since clean up is a fun and important part of any tea party anyway (and washing dishes instead of just throwing them in the dishwasher should happen sometimes). They also should NOT have hot liquids or be placed in the microwave. Now, this isn't a bad thing since this set is recommended for kids as young as 3 and I can't see serving a 3 year old tea with boiling water.We didn't quite get the "sunny patch" design. It has cute butterfly designs and the teapot is kind of a flower, but for "Sunny Patch" we were thinking Mrs. Spider's Sunny Patch so we were kind of thrown off by that.Overall a really good tea set that a child can actually use (no BPA or PVC - THANK YOU!!!). Just be careful with it (no microwave, no dishwasher) and it should last a long time!"

I manually sorted all the colors into individual compartments of Plano storage boxes (B000E3C3OE) so, over the coarse of a couple of hours, I handled pretty much every single band in the bag.  I did not count them so I can't comment on the accuracy of the number listed but the volume of the package seems consistent when compared to the smaller packs I have been buying.  No bad smells or anything to report as some others have mentioned but here are a few things of note;  Both bags were almost dead on with the amount of each color received.  Lots of green, white, black and orange.  Not so many red, pink, dark blue.  Other colors kind of average the others.  There seems to be a problem with the machine cutting the bands, especially green and light blue.  Both packages help a large number of broken green bands and some that were still together but paper thin in one area.  Same with the light blue color.  Not as many broken but several thin ones in both bags.  Overall, the sizes are fairly consistent but you'll occasionally run into a really thick one or a thinner than average one.  They still work fine for their purpose and both girls absolutely loved them.  That and the low, low price add up to four stars from me.  If you're looking for a lot of bands for not a lot of money and you're not overly perfectionist, this bag is for you."

I got something saying just Rattlesnake Eggs with a blue & green background. The packaging online shows &#34;For Ages 3+&#34; but the one I got says Ages 6 and Up. Since there is nothing stating how to use the product, I don't know how to teach my kids to make a rattlesnake sound as the package does state it should do, or how to get them to &#34;sing&#34; as the packaging on the product I ordered and did not even receive states that could be done with the magnets.

Not to mention that without the (not included) toy ladder, the odds of your child being able to successfully knock down anything other then the fake television screen are pretty slim as the launch angle does not allow you to aim at an action figure standing in the ring.My recommendation, pass on this one, it is basically a glorified piece of plastic junk, that requires even more expensive plastic junk to use."

nlp-input-text-134, "Let me preface this review - I know NOTHING about Beyblade, nor the accompanying cartoon.  There is a whole "cult" following around this game and all the different Blades.  Mostly young male.I chose this game because it looked cool and like something my 7 year old would like.  Well, he LOVED it.  But we had to watch several YOUTUBE videos before we got the hang of ripping the tops.  The arena comes with three inter-changeable bottoms, which make the tops behave differently, so you can always be switching the play area up.  The tops I know, I know, they are Beyblades and the launcher contraptions - are solidly constructed of heavy aluminum and heavy plastic.  They are well made.  The arena?  NOT so much.  Cheap crappy plastic.  As are the rip-chord things.  This set comes with additional stickers, directions and a score keeping pad for tournaments.This kit comes with the bottom of the rung top-launcher and that was the one issue I had.  It took me a lot of practice and watching the videos to see exactly how this thing worked.  So that's my big complaint - they could have thrown in two launcher guns.Now, how did this game save the day?  My kids are in-between summer camps right now and stuck in horrible, boring, snoring daycare - literally a parking lot all day.  Very sad, I know, I know.  My son brought this game in and it was played with for HOURS by all ages - K through 6 and all kids, everyone wanted to take a turn playing and they played it for over 4 hours.  The cheap crappy arena - held up brilliantly!  It didn't even have one scratch on it at the end of the day.  The tops?  Well, they looked battled - but were perfectly fine.  All the kids enjoyed playing and watching the tournaments.  Some kids have slick moves - like sliding into the arena.  It made for a very fun morning in an otherwise stifling, soul-sucking setting.I gave some stars for educational value because I think it teaches patience - your turn will come - and you also have to fill out the tournament diagrams - which is a bit like good old fashioned FINAL FOUR rankings.I might go ahead and add another two blades to the set - oh noooo, I'm becoming a Beyblade cult member!"

nlp-input-text-137, "This is different from the other Knight dress-up costumes because it's a set of molded plastic pieces.  My son wore it for Halloween, and some thought he was a gladiator.  He actually wore it over a cheap fabric/mesh hooded top that was designed to look like chainmail, so the effect of both put together was quite good.  He won a costume contest at a friend's party.  He loves the set, and there are so many pieces that it's a great value--chest plate, shield, sword (with scabbard) and helmet.  If you had only one knight dress-up set, this one will last. (I'm afraid to put the chainmail costume in the wash).DETAILS:  The chest plate has 2 plastic straps that go from the shoulder to the hip.  The strap attachment works like a backpack strap attachment--you feed the strap up and down through 2 horizontal slots.  Because the straps are plastic, it is not easily adjustable, and you can't tighten by simply pulling on the long tail once you've fed it through.  To keep it on a small child, you should criss-cross the straps in the back, otherwise, it'd be too loose and difficult to keep on.  With the straps criss crossed, it can be a little tricky to for a child to pull on over his head, and if it's adjusted too tight, the hard plastic will dig into the child's neck/collar bone.  Find a comfortably loose position, and keep it there.  The straps won't slip.  Once we found the right length, my 4 year old had no problem slipping it over his head by himself (and off again).  The helmet is too large for most children.  I rigged a ribbon chin strap with just a little elastic on the ends, and it was enough to keep the helmet from falling off."

The instructions (all pictures, which is good) involve 50 steps.  We worked together on the first half, but then his interest in the assembly process decreased .  (Of course, I had to see it all the way through.) Plus, some of the snap-together parts (the yellow rods in the picture) take a fair bit of strength to snap in, especially when the connection point is horizontal. And attaching the final parts (the top section with the Bat signal) can cause some other parts to come loose, because the structure can't take a lot of downward pressure.I didn't even try any of the alternate configurations.  As others have said, the booklet shows pictures, but not assembly instructions for them."

Cupid has made the jump from a minor Monster High character to an Ever After High Rebel &#8211; and I am so glad she did.  This doll is a beautiful addition to the EAH lineup.  Cupid is all about pink, and her other colors are white, bronze and black.  Cupid has bright turquoise blue eyes that are enhanced by her metallic pink eye makeup and long lashes.  A cute detail she has is that her eyes also have white heart-shaped highlights.  Her lips are pale pink with a darker pink heart painted on the middle.  Her long, curled pink hair and curled bangs are the same bright pink shade as her MH version, and the pink shade is quite a bit more intense than it appears in the promotional photo.  Her styling and expression are very sweet and less severe than the MH version.  Cupid is a darling.Cupid is the daughter of Eros, the winged god of love, so feather and heart details abound.  Her dress has a pink halter top with little metallic bronze wing cap details over her shoulders.  The skirt of her dress is a print of pink sky and white clouds overlaid with metallic pink heart tipped arrows.  The skirt is trimmed in black lace, and the top and front of the dress have a transparent bronze net apron.  Cupid also wears black fishnet stockings and gold winged high heel shoes.Cupid has many accessories, but the best are her removable wings.  The wings are white with bronze antiquing to bring out the pattern of the feathers.  The wings hang from the back of her neck by a collar that is shaped like an arrow.  Cupid holds her bronze bow and filigree covered quiver of arrows.  She wears black heart shaped earrings, a feather bracelet, black arrow ring, bronze and black feather belt, and a bronze headband with a pink heart and arrow decoration.Cupid comes with a doll stand, key shaped hair brush and fold out &#8220;bookmark&#8221; bio with details of her story.  Cupid is fully jointed, and can be posed multiple ways for play or display. Cupid is made for gentle play and has several small parts that could be damaged or lost if care is not taken with her.  She comes in the usual amazing EAH packaging that is styled to look like a storybook and displays her tagline, &#8220;Loves a Happily Ever After&#8221;.  Cupid is a beautiful fashion doll that will be loved by Ever After High and Monster High fans alike."

nlp-input-text-145, "There is a good reason why this toy is still popular more than 50 years later. It requires a variety of skills to make it work -- creativity, hand-eye coordination, technical understanding, and patience. And yet, somebody lacking any or all of those skills can still play with it. Anybody can doodle aimlessly on an etch a sketch, but with practice you can make something really special. And then, with just a shake, it disappears forever, as if it never was! There is something mysterious and magic about that whole concept, which is part of the fun. This is a toy, it is a skill development tool, and it is an artistic canvas. There is nothing else quite like it. It reminds you that art, like life, is fleeting, and if you can't find a philosophical meaning in the whole thing, then you might as well just shake it up and have fun with it. Gotta love the Etch a Sketch."

As the mom of two kids who enjoy K'Nex and lego, I am used to picking up and stepping on tiny little pieces of similar sets regularly.  But the effort on this toy far exceeds the enjoyment you experience by using it. It made 176 pieces feel like a thousand. My kids also really didn't develop the knack for the launching or the re-building, so it doesn't allow for much independent play.  Even though they love angry birds, and they enjoy K'Nex, they gave up on this one fairly quickly."

Wish I would have waited to catch this on sale (as well as the new Home Ick and Mad Science sets discounted last week), but oh well...We've owned this set since it was released in May and my kiddo and I both feel that Headmistress Bloodgood is an amazing doll, great quality as is deserved of any MH product. Taller than the average girl dolls, and with enough detail to her coat and the rest of her outfit. Her up-do will stay in place nicely, but of course if you're a collector you will keep her in the box anyway. Nightmare is a gorgeous horse with an equally lovely saddle and has had no problems withstanding hours of playtime.The only reason why this exclusive set isn't a full five stars is the lack of accessories. I LOVE the fact that there is another 'grown up' doll offered in the MH line, BUT there is no doll stand, no brush for either the doll or horse, no office/desk, nothing extra! What's worse, Nightmare seems like she was molded from discarded Barbie horse molds (we did a side by side comparison with a Barbie horse, but another reviewer pointed out the mold is from the Disney Princess horse line). These two characters deserve a better package presentation! Since this set retails well over what past offered sets have, I hoped Mattel and TRU would really wow fans. Love the Headmistress and glad I purchased, but kind of disappointed in the presentation especially for the price.  Definitely a MUST BUY at the sale price, but sadly not worth paying full retail plus shipping."

It shoots much further than most nerf guns.It is very easy to use and very intuitive.it is easy to load and easy to cock and easy to shoot. Like most nerf guns though, it is not accurate beyond a short distance.However, the one draw back on this gun is it seems to jam easier than many other nerf guns we own, and with two boys you can imagine we own quite a few nerf guns.The good news is there is this little handy orange dot on the side of the nerf gun by the trigger, you push on it and it unjams the bullet. It seems to work for us with very little problems.Because it shoots so far you have to imagine there is some power behind the shot. Part of the reason the darts shoot so far is they are very light. However, as several of us can attest to after being hit, if you are hit up close by one of these darts it can sting quite a bit.

On the other hand, it broke in such a way, that it is still useable. There are blue parts that allow the user to hold the loom together and add more looms to make more complex projects, and there are enough of these to hold the loom together even if it is broken. Decent mix of band colors included in the 600 enclosed. I'm still using it. Gives me something to do with my child who is enjoying another loom. And since I got it at Amazon for $3.60, what can I expect, right? If I had paid full price, I would have been mad, though."
nlp-input-text-167, "This was a gift from an older relative for my 7yo daughter, and I suspect that all the other kids in the extended family of the under the age of 10 received this as well.  Daughter enjoyed this set because it was a novel project and she loves markers.  Additionally the clear markers allow the kids to see capillary action and offers an opportunity for explaining the science behind the ink getting sucked into the marker base.We did not like the mess factor - we are almost ready to list our home for sale, including new neutral colored carpet, freshly painted trim and doors - and more, you get the idea.  Wish the relative would have taken this into account and waited until next Christmas to give this gift - it can be messy with the 3 bottles of non-permanent/but NOT washable ink.  The instruction page does indicate that the ink can stain.  Additionally, I felt that the ink colors were less vibrant than regular markers.Also, the ink was hard for daughter to squeeze into the measuring tubes.  Crayola wisely used durable plastic bottles with thicker plastic, but does make it hard for the younger ones to squeeze and therefore, we adults took on this task.  Also, putting the final bottom cap on was also difficult for 7yo to complete - she could get the first click, but never the final click to completely seal it shut.  We adults also helped with this.  The mechanism for this task (a lever) works well, but little kids have less leverage and strength.  Maybe would have been easier on the floor or a lower table.We will not keep the set and do not plan on refills as we are minimizing stuff in prep for a move and do not desire the potential mess.  Overall, a decent product that many kids would enjoy - just maybe not the parents."

It's breathtaking and, simply put, the best boardgame I ever played.However, make no mistake: if it has a scoring track running along all four sides of the game board, this is a Eurogame at heart :)This is not a licensed product developed in German and translated to English. It was designed by GMT (Chad Jansen).And what a game this is. Full of options for the players to decide each turn (that's the main reason the games lasts more than three hours, I guess), a fantastic theme (the Ice Age is coming! Which species will survive?), gorgeous components (mainly in the new 3rd printing released June 2012), clear and explicit rule book. And what's best: six players can play it, a rare fact indeed for this kind of strategy game.There is some "screwing another player" factor in this game. So, people who don'tlike a certain level of confrontation may be put aside by it. But even so, you may ty to avoi d it in a reasonable basis and still win. But tototally avoid the confrontationwould mean sure defeat.A fter all, this is indeed a battle amongst species.DOMINANT SPECIES has all the fun of a great strategy game, without any really negative side. However, one must be prepared to spend between three-four hours of playing. As it is the case with the majority of games of this type, the experience of playing it is highly enhanced iy you play it with the full capacity of players allowed (in this case, six players).I'd also recommend to never try to play this game with people who are new to Eurogames or this kind of strategy game. It would be better to begin with a simpler game (like STONE AGE or VIKINGS), then try DOMINANT SPECIES another day."

nlp-input-text-176, "Fun, quick game.  I play this game with my 9-year-old daughter.  There is some strategy but enough randomness that anyone can win no matter the age differences.I actually wish the game would take a little longer because some games can be over in minutes depending upon which cards are drawn.  However, this is also good because this is one of those games you can play when you don't want to play a long game.  I don't think we have ever went over 10 minutes for someone to win this game (and probably not that long).I have never played with other than two players, but I think 3 or 4 players would probably make the game even better.Edit:  After playing this more with various peoples, it appears that at some point it just digresses into a person trying to make a straight line across the board and stopping his opponent from beating him by using cards to remove opponent markers.  At this point it just becomes a luck of the draw kind of game.  And then the game gets played less and less."

The Price per Brick ratio is fantastic, and it includes 5 main characters Batman, Robin, Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn. The play features on this set are above and beyond expectations. A coaster like cart ride, Batcycle, and even an extra Riddler head! This is a Toys R Us exclusive but if you don't have a TRU you can find it at Amazon. Brick and Mortar Lego Stores don't carry it but you can find it online.Of all the Super Heroes playsets being released in 2012 (including the Marvel line) Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape is the most creative, enjoyable, and engaging Super hero set true to film,comics, and television.

nlp-input-text-182, "It is hard to find a game that my entire family can sit down with and enjoy. Either game is aimed at the younger members or our family, or it is better for the older members. Usually the grown ups have to give in to the kids. But now we have Hedbanz and we all have a great time playing it.The rules are simple: ask questions of the other players until you guess "what you are". Older players will tend to ask better questions, but younger players will have much sillier questions and answers that can really throw the adults off track!Of course, it is hard not to be silly when you have a card strapped to your forehead by a bright blue plastic band. We all had a blast! Sometimes it pays to be only 7 ask simple questions that lead you right to the answer. At other times, an adult can get themselves way off track. It was a ton of fun and this is our new game night favorite.We do have one complaint though: it only comes with 75 cards. You'll probably only go through 20 or so cards in a 4 person game, but this still means that you will start seeing the same cards after your 3rd game. No such a big problem for kids, but if you have 2 adults playing the games could start to get repetitive after a while.Overall, I highly recommend this game for a family or group with a broad age range. Everyone will have fun and can play at their own skill level."

At only $30 at the time of writing this review it's really a steal to get such a nice stuffed animal/dinosaur at that price. To me I think it's high quality from my perspective but that remains to be seen how long it will last when a child plays with it. I got it for my three are old nephew because I want to be the cool uncle that got them something really awesome. The one thing I love is how big it is my hope is that he remembers it when he gets bigger like I remember some of my toys.So basically if you have a kid who loves dinosaurs this really is one of the coolest present I found on Amazon. And the box it comes in is pretty gigantic.Thanks for reading!"

If you find that highly offensive (and lots of people understandably will) then stick with apples to apples. It is definitely for a certain audience, and choose your company carefully! Once that is out of the way, get ready to laugh, and laugh and laugh and then cry. We have played this with many different groups, and it is outstanding fun.Repeats are rare as the combos are almost endless. We also got the first expansion, which is great and even raunchier! The randomness and variety is the best part, to see what your friends come up with Example: Q: what was Michael Jackson's dying thoughts? A: switching to Geico.  Unfortunately some of the answers only fit with a handful of cards, and I find the expansion helps with this."

nlp-input-text-200, "Beast Hunters Shockwave is one of the best!Shockwave returns in transformers prime more badass than ever.This is the coolest version of the Decepticon scientiest since the G1 days.Shockwave has a perfect blend of the beastly attitude combined with the signature G1 style.The head sculpt on this bad boy is amazingly done to perfection with quality articulation throughout the rest of the transformer overall.The detail in both robot and cybertronian tank mode is awesome as well with perfect prime series accuracy.The Cybertronian Tank mode is one of the coolest and improved vehicle modes for Shockwave since the G1 days as well.Shockwave comes with his signature Hyperflux Cannon for the series which has realistic spinning action that is very simple to activate by pushing the button on the arm.Shockwave uses the left tank tredd to connect to the arm for the complete signature look.Shockwave does come with some cool as hell snap-on beast armor that gives him a more menacing beastly appearence.The beast armor is optional to have on or off,so its all in what you think looks better.The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or displaying this gem where you please.The durability is excellent as well with secure ball joint construction and a solid build in either robot or cybertronian tank mode.All parts fit securely together during the transformation process for one solid constructed transformer overall.The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is mid-level difficulty.If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 you might need to help some in the transformationj process.Honestly Shockwave does have a versatile transformation that 5 and above can learn easily after a little practice.To start off disconnect the tank tredd from the arm.Next you rotate the legs around sideways as the legs then will rotate straight up.Rotate the shins and feet down then rotate inwards.The feet rotate down as the next step involves you sliding the feet forward.Rotate the chest piece down so it's between the legs as the head piece will rotate around.The back piece with the tank tredds rotate out as the two purple sections on the chest area slide outwards.The arm with a hand will rotate down and then in forming a L-shape.The arm will then connect underneath as the weapon arm will do the same above.The weapon piece will connect to the middle part on top.Reconnect the tank tredd and Shockwave is ready to roll into battle!In vehicle mode the Hyperflux Cannon is stationary with no side to side movement,but this is not a big deal for how awesome the overall transformer is.If you are a fan of Shockwave this is one Voyager class version that is a masterpiece of quality that will be a treasure in your world of transformers.Bottom line Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Shockwave is a well-made,high quality,10 out of 10 transformer all fans will enjoy.I highly recommend Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Shockwave to all transformer fans and collectors out there.Shockwave Rocks and Transformers Rule!!!"
nlp-input-text-201, "I bought this for a friend who had a toddler.  This pool has served so many purposes and it is very durable.  My friend has put it in the yard where her daughter plays and plays.  Her daddy complains that she loves it so much, she doesn't even notice when he comes home.  She has also taken it to the beach (Zanzibar) and filled it with water and her daughter just plays and plays it there.  She has taken it side of Kilimanjaro, set it up and filled it with water there and her daughter just plays and plays.  She and another toddler friend leap into it and out, splash each other to their hearts content.  It seems very safe and has lasted two years now.  Guess that is pretty good when it gets a hard workout all year long."
nlp-input-text-202, "This is a great game that everyone in your family will enjoy. The goal is simple---unscramble the phrase.We play this with our two children (ages 6 and 8). I was a little concerned that our six year old would not be competitive, but she has actually won the game before and does not find it difficult at all.The best part about this game are all the options. As an example, each player can have his or her own difficulty level. The phrases included are generic enough so that most people will get them. As a rule, if anyone knows the phrase---they have to help the person whose turn it is by letting them know the phrase. This is nice as some of the phrases are geared toward younger kids (e.g. "Nuetron", "The" "Adventures", "Of", "Jimmy") so the kids actually help us.If you enjoy sitting around the table with your family playing games---this is a must have!"

This toy is worth the money works well for batting and catching.This  would be great for little girls who are going to play softball also.Only negative is it only comes with two balls and the extra balls are to expensive."

It is great for pretend play now as they are too young to learn fractions. However, I have already started teaching them the concept of part vs. whole thanks to this set. The pizza box is a very thin cardboard so I am not certain how long that will hold up but the set itself looks like it will last years."
nlp-input-text-205, "My two-year-old is absolutely obsessed with vehicles, particularly school buses, so when I saw this toy, it seemed like just the thing for him.  It wasn't until after we got it that I really examined what it could do and I realized what a great concept it is.The vehicles can easily be split into half, and all parts are interchangeable.  This means my son can play with the school bus as is or we can take it apart and reconstruct it as a half school bus/half fire truck.  Naturally, the more of these sets you own, the wider the variety of mixed-up vehicles you can create.When two sides are joined, they can be turned, winding them up.  Once they're fully wound, you can set them down, push the button on top, and off they go.  I really like the button feature because, unlike conventional windup toys, these vehicles don't take off until my son is good and ready for them to do so.Because my son's younger than the recommended age, he does have difficulty getting the two parts together, but he has learned how to wind them up, thanks to his eight-year-old system, who also enjoys playing with them.  It's fun to watch my little guy put them on the floor, press the button, and then laugh his little head off when they take off.  They've been quite a hit with him, and I'd recommend them for the car-crazy little person in your life.  Oh, and their parents will thank you for buying a fun toy that moves but doesn't require batteries."

There are a set of markers, sticky flowers, glitter glue and material to decorate the kittens with.  The markers were lots of fun as was the glitter glue.  The sticky-backed flowers worked well too.  The least fun part was the material that had to be glued on (and would not stay!)  But all in all, we had a blast and I think I will get these again for my other niece.  FYI I also bought and tried the glitter bobblehead dog set but that one was mostly glue-based without the other fun stuff and wasn't nearly as big of a hit."

At least I found putting all the little pieces together a bit of a challenge. I had a few minor problems with the sail assembly and a few times I had to backtrack because I misread the pictures in the booklet, but personally, that's what I enjoy about Lego--the challenge and personal involvement.Tho, to be completely honest, the real stars of the show, as always, are the mini-figs, and wow, what a selection you get with this set. You get the three main characters, a good representation of the Army of the Dead, a couple of Orcs with their own battle wagon, and to top things off, they included a Cosair Pirate as well. Needless to say, one of the most generous selections of mini-figs I've seen yet. Also, if your a fan of little tiny accessories--treasure chests, wine bottles, loafs of bread, gold coins, spare weapons--there's plenty of that included too.In short, a really worthwhile set. The hundred dollar price tag is more than justified. If your a LOTR fan, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it. It's one of the better sets I've seen, and that's saying a lot."

The story feature is good!Like some of the other reviewers remarked the kitchen side just has a door and 2 sliding items inside the fridge - wish it could have been a little more, but it is a great toy anyway!And I love that it has not just an on/off switch, but that it has 2 levels of volume (so the doorbell doesn't drive you crazy!).Overall, I say it is a definite winner!"

He loves this, but now that he's got the hang of it, I need to raise up the seat.  Initially it was a bit difficult to steer, but that's user error on my part, I couldn't quite line up the handlebar. What's a little weird is if the handlebar is facing correctly, the triangle plastic on the lower back base of the handle bar isn't front center. Hard to explain.  I think my husband fixed it so it's a bit better now. It's a hit and I hope this helps them for when they are ready for big boy bikes. Somehow our 2 year old has taken to this more than the 4 year old, or perhaps since the seat height is for him.  What would be great is for the seat to be easily adjustable like the handle bar of the Maxi Scooter, or some other balance bikes like the Shazam, is it?  In the end, I picked this because the tires never need pumping and the adjustability, but I sure do hope the Strider Bike company makes it easier to change seat height without using a wrench.  I also got him a blue Shark Helmet like this to use with it:Raskullz Shark Attax Helmet - Ages 3+"

It's not like that at all if you know which toy I was thinking of (I'm 36).With that being said my 5 yr old absolutely loves it!  At first I thought you were supposed to use the colored pencils that came with it to draw using the stencils, then I found the black pen with the very skinny tip.  Perfect!  I'm going to have to find more of those pens somewhere so he can draw in different colors.  No wonder the pencils kept breaking, but still - we have a paper full of multi-colored dolphins that he just loves!You can make so many pictures with this and after you use the pen for the stencil part you can use the colored pencils to color pictures in.  The pencils aren't the best quality and it only includes 3, we'll have to get him more of the pens and pencils for a Christmas gift.  If they have other themes of this kind of toy I'd buy him another one, too.  He loves the ocean themed one we got and uses it at least every other day and I'm sure he'd love another one, too!  This is great for those rainy days and we get to see what kinds of things we can make!  We've got lots of swimming mermaids with little shells and fish to go along with the dolphins and their fishy friends and starfish!  He loves it!!  I'd definitely recommend it to keep a smaller kid busy in a way  other than some electronic game all the time, this fosters creativity and that's great!"
nlp-input-text-216, "This is such a beautiful puzzle, filled with over a dozen different animals having a good time in their zoo. There's an added special touch: the box doubles as a tote, with a blue cloth rope anchored through small metal eyelets on each side.Regarding quality, the puzzle's soy-based inks are brilliantly colorful. The shiny surface of the puzzle will mirror surrounding light sources. The manufacturing process is noticeable, shown as slight bulges on several corners, but it doesn't detract from the fun. The pieces are rigid, but feel somewhat easily flexible. The tote-style box, as cool as it is, can be bent with little effort - mine actually has a couple of dents from the pieces jostling about from within during shipping, though I give the product the same rating I would give were the box perfectly shaped.If I had this as a toddler, I'd have loved this puzzle. I'm guessing a chunk of the cost is for the rope handle, but then again, that's one of this puzzle's two charming attributes; the other being the fun scene it depicts. Does it get any cuter than a penguin holding his nose as he drops, feet first, into the water? Only if there's an elephant giving a jubilant jaguar a bath on his back!"

Fortunately, this worked like a charm every time.As an FYI, this doll is about the size of a Barbie, so you could probably change costumes or use Rapunzel with Barbie toys."

Changing the battery did not help.  Seems to be a problem in the switch.  I emailed Amazon and they quickly sent out a replacement.  Hopeing this one works better."
nlp-input-text-227, "My 7 and 9 year old granddaughters love this!  They spend hours making bracelets, rings, and necklaces.  I did buy a larger plastic storage container to put different colored bands into to keep all the colors separated.  They got this for Christmas and have been busily making bracelets!  They have a 1 1/2 year old younger brother who puts things into his mouth - so, be forewarned.  This is not to be around younger children."
nlp-input-text-228, "When the instructions on a product tell you to insert play doh and then to push the lever down, you would expect that it would come out the other side of the lever exactly as it is supposed to. This, however, didn't happen with this kit. My daughter received this for her 6th birthday, and we put it together right after her party because she was so eager to play with it. We inserted the play doh into the soft serve section and pulled the lever. While some play doh did come down to make a soft serve-like pretend ice cream, much of it squeezed out of the side of the machine instead. We messed around with it for 20 minutes trying to figure out what we were doing wrong, and all we could do to make ice cream was to put a very little bit of play doh into the machine at a time in order to make the soft serve.And the sprinkle machine? Is a joke. You can barely put any play doh into the machine to create sprinkles with! The chip maker in the hamburger set was much better than this sprinkle machine is. And cleaning it is next to impossible, as the other reviewers have stated as well.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because my son and daughter did have fun playing with it. We used the scoop and had fun with all of the different molds scattered all around the toy. But all in all? This was a very poor design."

Ours also came with some kind of strange smell, but within about 24 hrs of letting them air out it was gone.  By the way, crayon wipes off easily."
nlp-input-text-234, "My 3 year old grandson played with this for almost four hours straight. I've never seen him stay interested in any toy for that long before -- and it's so great to see him using his imagination like that. Really great toy!"
nlp-input-text-235, "I purchased this for my 2yo.  It's a really neat set with a simple concept -- dry erase board with activity sheets that you slide under the plastic.  Realistically, my 2yo isn't very adept at writing or drawing - but we have fun as a family drawing things and writing out letters and numbers for the 2yo to learn and repeat.  I think we'll get several years of use from this toy - and I understand that Crayola has downloads so you can print other activities to slide under the plastic. The contraption stores the extra activity sheets in the &#34;behind plastic&#34; compartment with a little flip piece to lock the sheets in place. 4 stars because I have a feeling that the plastic flip lock won't hold up forever and it only holds 4 markers to the dismay of my kid."

nlp-input-text-239, "My two year old daughter is very imaginative, and is a huge Disney fan, so these figurines were practically made for her. She likes to pack them up in her backpack and take them to grandma's or the doctor's office. At home, she can keep busy with them for an hour or two at a time, and I love listening to all the little "conversations" they have with each other while she is playing. They're also great to collect, as Disney makes several different sets of characters for all the different movies.The only recommendation I would make is to purchase them at the Disney Store (or on their website if you don't have one near you) as the prices are significantly better there - at the time of this writing, Amazon has them listed for over $24. I just came from my local Disney store where they were selling two sets for $20 (they're normally $12.50 per set)."
nlp-input-text-240, "I bought three for the girls. They have gone through 3000 bands and made hundreds of bracelets and charms since Christmas. One broke a tip being used by the younger girl, but is still useable. The others girls are more careful. I bought another one recently to allow them to make belts and it was very low quality so I wish I had stayed with this one. It is easy to use, disassemble and put back together. It is great for long boring trips and waiting in doctor offices.Look on YouTube for videos. I only wish it came with two of the hooks they are constantly losing that tiny piece and having to search for it. Also buy twice as many rubber bands as you think you will need and give them out as incentives, you WILL need them. Example, Do the dishes, here is some bands, watch your brother so I can work, here are some more rubber bands, Valentine's gift have some rubber bands, etc. Entertainment value 100%., value for the money 99% (could be stronger material), brownie points earned 100%."

nlp-input-text-244, "We've had a bunch of magformers for years and thought this sounded like a good way to change them up a bit. The light up part is awesome! There's a number of standard building pieces included that this could be a starter set or an add-on if you already have some.There's one light unit (kinda wish there were two) that can be constantly changing colors or can be set to one color. It has a recharging cord included which is so much better than needing to replace the batteries when we forget to turn it off!"
nlp-input-text-245, "This is an adorable baby toy, with or without the batter operated features.The active features may be good for toddlers, but certainly babies can also enjoy the cute bear, as well. It appears to be perfectly safe, as the battery compartment sits inside a Velcro-closed pocket tucked into the bear's back, but if you worry you can take the batteries out while baby remains very small, and save the the action features for later.That, presumably, explains the manufacturer's wide age range on this item. Nice."
nlp-input-text-247, "This was one of the best presents I purchased this year. My little girl can't get enough of this new addition to her dollhouse ! She enjoys packing up the RV and taking the family on a vacation. The accessories it comes with really adds to the fun. If you have a little one who likes dolls and has a great imagination, then buy this without any more thought."
nlp-input-text-248, "I bought this as a gift for my 12 year old cousin who is into all those crafty things now a days. She absolutely loves it! She spent days making some adorable looms bracelets. The design is very simple and very easy to use (for kids and adults). It will keep the child occupied for hours and it will allow them to explore creativity with unique designs! Highly recommended. Also, we couldnt find this anywhere, except amazon. No complaints, as always! :)"
nlp-input-text-249, "My daughter wants to read so badly.  She is on the road and can read simple books but sometimes she just wants to "read" on her own.  This is why we love the Tag system.This Tag pen is the key to the system.  Once you own the pen, here is what you need to do.-  Buy a Tag book or another Tag product. (They now sell maps, animal cards, puzzles, and games that go with the Tag system.)-  Plug your Tag pen into your computer using the USB cable provided.-  Set up you LeapFrog Learning Path for your child.  This allows you to track your child's progress and see what they are working on.-  Download the book (or other item) to your pen.-  Give it to your child for FUN!Here is how the pen works.-  Once a book is downloaded to the pen you child simple touches certain areas of the book and the pen reacts.-  Touch the words, and the pen reads the story to your child.-  Touch the pictures for sound effects that go along with the story.-  Each page also has a learning game that goes along with that pages.-  At the end of each book is usually a reading skill game with different levels.We love the Tag system.  No, it does not replace reading to your child.  We still do this every night as part of our bedtime routine.  That said, my daughter still loves that she can "read" on her own.  It is great for the car, on airplanes, and at times when mom is busy.LeapFrog makes a quality product and you are sure to find a TAG item that your child will enjoy.  My older son, who is a great reader still uses his TAG.  He loves the maps and the solar system Tag products.  He can touch on a state, country or planet and learn new and interesting facts.  Proof that this toy can grow with your child."
nlp-input-text-250, "We opened this box with my 4,5 years old son Saturday morning and it keeps my son occupied for the whole weekend. As it was a little difficult for my son to use the enclosed tool I helped him. You really need a patience to this kind of activity. Hint: wet the block with water to make the process easier. We have found 13 gems inside the plaster and each one brought a lot of fund for my son. Also he liked the process and finally started to dig some "caves" and "tunnels" inside this block. It's a good toy."

Very cute addition to my daughter's Webkinz collection (she currently has 20). She named this one Hershey, since chocolate is her favorite food. This dog is soft, and sweet, and sure to be loved for a long time. She also can play online with a code on the dog's tag that lets you play in a virtual world of Webkinz. Hours of fun play whether it's playing the the toy itself, or playing on the computer. Well worth investing in as a collector too."

nlp-input-text-256, "As a Mega Man fan from the beginning, I've witnessed Zero go through some changes. In addition to armor changes, he has used a Buster, a Z-Saber and at times both.  This amazing replica of Zero from MMX1 is Zero at his original design.  This is the best recreation of Zero in any figure/toy line I've ever seen.  He stands taller than X when putting both figures side-by-side.  He has excellent detail and wonderful articulation, capable of many heroic poses.  Like the X figures of the D-Arts series Zero comes with a Buster Shot, plus multiple face and fist configurations. I am really looking forward to the second series issue of Zero, with the squared shoulder armor and Z-Saber.  Pick Zero up and add him to your collection!  He's worth it!"

nlp-input-text-258, "We are having a "Lego Duplo" birthday party for my son and I wanted to buy party favors that the kids would actually use instead of cheap little trinkets that get tossed.  I decided to buy these---figuring I would divide them up among the seven children who will be at the party.  I was happy to find that they are nicely packed into bags of 8 - 10 pieces each (maybe 6 bags of mixed colors of the 2x2s, maybe 5 bags of the 2x8s--mixed colors, as well as a bag of bricks with eyes, a bag of thin 2x8 bricks, and maybe 6-10 long bricks and a few smaller base plates---don't quote me on the sizes and amount of bags--but there have to be about 12 or so prepackaged bags).Needless to say, I now don't have to count out bricks---I just have to toss a bag and possibly a few extra bricks into each child's party favor bag....and each child has Duplos to add to the ones they have at home.  And my son has a few more bricks to add to his collection.I ordered these from the Wizard of Math (fulfilled through Amazon for $44)---they came in a large brown box that had "Lego Duplos Education" labels on it  (item #9027, which is not found on the Lego website)--with photos of what is included (like normal)---so they are authentic :)  I am very happy with the set and would recommend it."

It's also pretty intimidating in term of the sheer size, so there's that.I would have given it 5 stars except for the following:1) Some pictures in the assembly manual are kind of small making it hard to tell what's going on.2) Some of the track attachment instructions are basically wrong - they work but there are much better ways to connect the track.3) The tracks are not actually the same on both sides even though they appear to be.  The connectors do not hold if snapped on one way, but will hold if the track is flipped over.  This is fine with the flat track but you can't always do this with the curved track.4) Some pieces appeared to be missing in our set - a rare occurrence - our other KNEX kits were perfect on this.5) I had to tweak the design to get the chain to stay on the trackOverall the kids had a HUGE amount of fun putting this together (as did I).  I did end up making one significant change - just before the cars go back onto the chain I swapped the track - the green goes to yellow and the yellow track goes to green.  This now means that the ride, instead of being two separate but somewhat identical rides, is now one double length ride.I will try to add some pictures showing the key changes I made to make the chain stay on as well as to fit the track better.If you have any questions or comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!"

I had been looking for something comprable to the ones she had at school.  The price on this is amazing.  I was originally looking on Lakeshore and I would have had to pay double.  This toy will be for her to begin experimenting with magnets and I think its a great starter set.  I plan to hide magnetic objects in a bin covered with rice or whatever and let her seek the items out, should provide many fun moments."

We have to help build the playground but she stacks the pegs and and the big monkeys and loves to send the little monkeys down the slide and crank them up to the tree house platform, and landscape with the palm trees.  She will be able to enjoy this toy for a long time as her dexterity increases and she can construct the playground herself.  I also like the fact that we can expand on this with other Lauri tall stacker toys."

They had a great time laughing, trash talking and setting up mini tournaments.  However now about a month later, it has sat in the closet, unplayed, for at least 3 straight weeks.I had never heard of these before being offered a reviewer set, but my kid sure had.  He knew that the tops were collectible and modifiable.  He could even describe the section in Target even though he had never played it. I was impressed as he told me how they can be reconfigured to have different fighting characteristics.  I am awed by the wisdom of the marketers to make it so you could always buy more accessories.In general, the toy is well made. We did have a little issue with one of the ripcords that is a little warped and catches in the top, but we fix it by occassionally bending the tip back the other way. Otherwise it was fun to play, it just doesn't seem to hold your attention for long periods of time.  For dollar to time used ratio, I would have gone with Legos."

I had a big problem getting a new machine from Funrise but they did replace my defective machine six months later.The main reason I am posting this review is related to the price listed here - I got mine for about half this price.  Toys R Us sells them at their stores for a much more reasonable price."
nlp-input-text-275, "I bought this for my son, Christmas 2006, since he liked "helping" me clean the house.  The back of the vacuum tilts down just like the real thing, so he can "vacuum" under his bed.  There is a tiny button near the light that makes very realisitic vacuum humming.  My son uses his foot to turn it on and off, in an effort to copy me. I have not had to change the light bulb, and it runs on three AAA batteries.  I use rechargeable batteries, but I've only had to replace them once, despite how often my son uses it.  I know it's durable because I've caught my son stepping on the handle, when the back was laying flat, and it didn't crack or break.  When he is a little older, we will upgrade to theDirt Devil Toy Vacuum Jr., so he can be responsible for his own room.November 13, 2009Vacuum is still running great and my 4yr son still likes pretending to clean with it."

The basket on the end for a "pet bed" was a great idea, and the blanket and pillow are a cute pattern. It is easy to clean, just wipe down the bed and wash the pillow and blanket!

My son is 10 and although he did manage to get all 3 of the mazes rather quickly, it didn't stop him from trying over and over and OVER again.  Just like any toy, they do get bored and will move on to another but I have no doubt he'll be bringing this out again.  I have never mastered any of the mazes but I didn't spend 8 hours a day practicing either :)"

nlp-input-text-282, "My girls (2 and 4) love this toy.  We haven't had the trouble other reviewers mentioned with the markers.  I've found the marker wipes off quite easily.  With a baby wipe, it even comes off of the wood part where it isn't intended to be used.  I was even able to get it off of my hardwood floor, and the marks had been there for an entire day before I noticed them.  This set has been an immediate favorite with my kids, who have a lot of other kitchen toys to choose from.  It's very durable; even the little paper cupcake liners are made of heavy paper, much thicker than real cupcake liners.  I do wish that Melissa and Doug toys still came with a lid for the storage box, other than, no complaints."

I emailed the company (NOT Amazon) immediately, didn't hear back in time, and had to return these.  The company blamed Amazon for the problem.. which is strange, since after about 10 years I have had one problem with Amazon.  Weird.Also, the product was odd, the target is INCREDIBLY small, and the suction cups didn't stick the first time, and only time, that we tried.  Maybe it's great, but not for us.

Solid construction and it's all green, so you can feel good about your purchase!  My toy testers were 3 and 4 years old so they already knew it was a rocket, etc.  However, if you use with a younger child, yes, you may have to sit and play with them and teach them about rockets, astronauts and space adventures!  Great lesson!  Everything in life is a teachable moment! Solid 5 stars for imaginative play, solid construction and being green in the USA!"

nlp-input-text-288, "I got this Tamagotchi through the Vine review program.  I should disclose that I have never owned one of these, never played with one and I don't have much comparison between this and earlier versions which evidently were smaller.Here is my opinion.Set up was easy - I didn't bother to read the directions and I was able to get it "set up" with current date and time, name and birthday.Next the little animated character "hatched" and then I decided to look at the directions because pushing random buttons had no effect.  So then I figured out how to navigate through the tamagotchi "world".  Directions were easy and in under a minute I had navigated to a game called "cradle" where you drop things down on moving ledges and have to have the ledges catch the thing.So that was ok.  Not something I could do for hours but this would be quite distracting or entertaining for the younger set.  Maybe 8 year olds up to 12 year olds?  Maybe older - hard to know.Screen was easily readable.  The egg thing sits upright on it's own without a stand.  The little characters easily slide right on top of the egg and are anchored firmly.  I like the fact that the "door" is attached with a chain so you can't easily lose it.Takes 2 AAA batteries.  I don't know how long they will hold out since I just got this today.  All in all this would make a nice stocking stuffer or small gift for a kid.  I am sure they would have no problem playing this if I had no problem figuring it out."

There are bigger, and prettier ones that can be found at the chain craft stores for a good price, and I wish I had got those instead.  These did the trick, but there are better ones available.  They were a hit at her birthday party, and everyone liked decorating them, even a couple of adults.  They didnt' really wear them, even though I am sure they would have fit fine as the adjustable cord seems to be a great system for that."

However, kids (both girls AND younger brothers, cousins, and neighbors) go crazy over this thing and will play with it for hours upon hours.  The ferris wheel is super cute and generously sized, considering how small the Ponyville figures are.  And, while the set only comes with one figure, the smaller ponies are pretty easy to find in giftsets.  We have been able to fit ponies and mermaid ponies into the seats, as well as my little pony stampers and figurines from other toy brands (Strawberry Shortcake, mini/baby Disney Princess, Toy Story figures, etc).This playset is fun and DEFINITELY worth the post-holiday sale prices - less than FIVE BUCKS over at TRU (the biggest toy story there is)!!! Granted, basic shipping bumps up the price, but it's still worth it considering what retail is.  Awesome gift "just because" or as a birthday surprise; just think of all the accolades you'll get when you bring this out of the gift closet!Just wish this had been around when *I* was 5 years old!!!"

nlp-input-text-294, "This product is completely adorable, but the rounded back makes it difficult for the child to stay on. Plus, my daughter has long legs and it sits quite low, so she was never actually able to use it--got it for her for her 1st bday and she couldn't stay on. Near her 2nd bday her legs were too long. Never got to enjoy it."
nlp-input-text-295, "Was a good price, but you get what you pay for. I was a little disappointed in the quality of this product."
nlp-input-text-296, "There is nothing more to say than the title.My 10-year-old granddaughter loves this and it remains set up in her room."
nlp-input-text-297, "This was a gift from Grandma for our 18 month old.  Our daughter figured out how to cut a few months later.  It's perfect for age two and up.  She loves to cut up all the fruits, veggies, and bread.  It comes with two cutting boards and two knives so a friend can play along too.  It keeps her entertained for a long time and, as others have mentioned, teaches her the names of a few fruits and veggies along the way.  Everything comes in a nice wooden box with a slide-on lid, which is great for storing all the pieces and for the fun of "in and out" of the box.  My only complaint is that the velcro stickers which hold the pieces together are not compeletly durable.  I've reglued a few of them, which has been no big deal to do.  Overall a great toy, well priced, and nicely made."
nlp-input-text-298, "This boombox is cute, but I have to agree with a lot of what I read in other reviews.  It would be nice if the figures came off the top, and it is pretty loud (which makes it pretty annoying most of the time).  I actually bought it to be used as part of a &#34;DJ Lance Rock&#34; costume for my husband for Halloween, it served that purpose really well!"
nlp-input-text-299, "Like the title says, there isn't much to this camera but my son still plays with it regularly.  There is one button on top that you can press and a couple of rolling balls on the front.  It plays a few tunes and says a few of phrases like "say cheese" or "smile".  It teaches a little about emotions like happy and sad and the switch on top says on and off and hello and goodbye.  I think it is okay for younger babies but it's a bit bulky.  It has a handle for carrying and a little light on the side.  I got it for my son when he was 12 months old because we were going on a trip and needed some new little things to keep him busy on the plane.  It didn't keep his attention for long but ever since we got home we keep it by his potty and he will play with it a little almost every day at potty time.  It's a good small toy but it just isn't that interesting for long at all.  I think it could have more to it but it probably would be more interesting to a 6 month old than my son."
