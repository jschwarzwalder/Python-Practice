# Given two numbers, represented as a linked list, where the head is pointing to the
# most significant digit, write a program that adds the two numbers, and creates a new linked
# list that stores the sum.

# Create Linked List

# Assign Node.value to first digit

# Create new node

# Assign current Node.next to new node

# Assign new nodes Node.prev to current node

# Assign the new Node.value to second digit

# Create new node

# Assign current Node.next to new node

# Assign new nodes Node.prev to current node

# Assign the new Node.value to first digit + second digit

# Point tail to this last node
